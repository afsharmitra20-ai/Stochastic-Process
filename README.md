# Stochastic-Process
Stochastic Processes and MCMC Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of fundamental stochastic processes using Python. The project explores statistical modeling, data fitting, and uncertainty estimation through practical coding exercises.
It covers the journey from basic Gaussian distributions to advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, demonstrating how to fit complex models to data and analyze posterior distributions.
Key Features and Implementations
Gaussian Distributions and Processes
Implemented algorithms to fit Univariate and Multivariate Gaussian distributions to raw datasets.
Simulated and visualized Gaussian processes using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to understand variability.
Brownian Motion Analysis
Generated multiple realizations of Brownian motion (Wiener process).
Applied statistical techniques (Linear Regression and Differencing) to detrend stochastic signals for stationary analysis.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
Built the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from scratch (without relying solely on high-level libraries) to fit linear models.
Calculated Likelihood functions (Chi-Squared) and analyzed Posterior probability distributions.
Used corner.py to visualize parameter correlations and uncertainties.
Extended the MCMC framework to fit non-linear (quadratic) models to complex datasets.
Technologies Used
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Corner.py
About the Project
